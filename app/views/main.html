  <h2>What is this site?</h2>
  <p>We continuously monitor the status of myserver.com and all its related services. If there are any interruptions in service, a note will be posted here.</p>

  <h2>What are these graphs?</h2>
  <p>These graphs are sampled periodically from our own internal metrics about the performance and availability of MyServer services. Theyâ€™re accurate to within a few minutes.</p>

  <p>We provide a MyServer Site Status API for consuming this information. If you're a service that integrates with GitHub, you can use these JSON responses to populate your own status dashboard.</p>
